Python Challenge
In this challenge, we analyze a profit/loss chart displaying the total, average change, and greatest increase and decrease over the months. We also analyze a sample vote for candidates, determining who won and what percent of votes each candidate got, as well as exporting both sets of results to text files.
Some code (noted in comments of each script) sourced from classmates and from https://datagy.io/python-write-text-file/ .
Update 1: Reworked code slightly to store the headers as variables instead of just skipping past them. Also double checked the greatest profit and greatest loss of PyBank resource file to make sure that the greatest increase and decrease I got was correct, which it is (as seen below):

Greatest Increase comparison:
Mar-13,1141840 (line 40)
Aug-16,951227 (line 81)

Greatest Decrese comparison:
Dec-10,-1194133 (line 13)
Feb-14,-946748 (line 51)
