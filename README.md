Python Challenge
In this challenge, we analyze a profit/loss chart displaying the total, average change, and greatest increase and decrease over the months. We also analyze a sample vote for candidates, determining who won and what percent of votes each candidate got, as well as exporting both sets of results to text files.
Some code (noted in comments of each script) sourced from classmates and from https://datagy.io/python-write-text-file/ .
